# ticketing

## Introduction
MERN stack ticketing app based on Steven Grider's course on Udemy

https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/

## Description üìù
This is a web app that allowed me to explore microservices in production environments.
The client interface is pretty bare bones as the project focused on the microservices aspect of the project.
Behind the scenes, there are 6 independent services managing the different features supported by the platform:
- Authentication
- Ticket Expiration
- Orders
- Payments
- Tickets
- Client

Each service is designed to act independently (from development to deployment). The Continuous Integration (CI) is done through github actions validating the build and tests are successful for services which have been worked on. Post validation, the updated services are deployed to a hosting provider via kubernetes such as DigitalOcean or AWS.

Common logic, middleware, types, etc. are stored on a publicly hosted NPM repository which standardizes definitions and related content between services. This ensures that all information is uniform across each server.
